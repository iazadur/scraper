docker-compose up --build -d
```

## 📊 Application Features

The dockerized application includes:

- **News Scraping**: Automated news collection from Bangladeshi sources
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for accessing news data
- **Background Processing**: Celery workers for asynchronous tasks
- **Task Scheduling**: Automated periodic scraping with Celery Beat
- **Monitoring**: Flower dashboard for task monitoring
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence
- **Caching**: Redis for task queue and caching
- **Geolocation**: News article location detection
- **Deduplication**: Automatic duplicate news removal

## 🔍 Testing the Application

Test the deployment:

```bash
# Check if the API is running
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Check application health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# View API documentation
open http://localhost:8000/docs

# Monitor Celery tasks
open http://localhost:5555
```

## 📈 Production Considerations

For production deployment:

1. **Security**: Change default MongoDB credentials
2. **Environment**: Use production environment variables
3. **SSL/TLS**: Configure HTTPS for API endpoints
4. **Monitoring**: Set up proper logging and alerting
5. **Backup**: Implement database backup strategies
6. **Scaling**: Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for scaling

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Your application is successfully dockerized with:
- ✅ All services containerized
- ✅ Proper service orchestration
- ✅ Health checks implemented
- ✅ Environment isolation
- ✅ Easy deployment and management
- ✅ Monitoring capabilities
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

**Your Bangladesh News Scraper is now production-ready and running in Docker! 🎉**
